# Modular walkways
A set of modular walkways based on [Wyloch's Armory's Modular Roads for Warhammer 40k](https://youtu.be/NG9LTeQYOoY).

# Walkways.svg
You need three layers, a top, a bottom and a middle that you sandwich together to form a walkway.
If using type 1 top you should insert a plastic grating in the hole in the middle layer. If using
type 2 you can remove the cutout in the middle.

# Connectors.svg
The clamp consists of four layers and is used to connect two towers and the tab is used to connect walkways.

# Tower.svg
To construct a tower you need 2 sandwiches of bottom, middle and top layers (with your selected decoration),
1 middle tower and 4 corner struts. The tower and the struts can be constructed from other materials
(drinking straws, empty paper roll etc.) to wary the look.
