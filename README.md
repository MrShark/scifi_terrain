# scifi_terrain
A collection of laser cutable wargaming terrain for Sci-Fi games. 

# Design parameters
* All designs should be scaled for 15mm wargaming which is aproximatly 1:100 scale.
* All designs should be for 3mm material
* All lines should be 1px wide
* Black lines are for cutting
* Red lines are for line engraving
* Blue areas are for area engraving (should be also filled blue)
* Green elements are anotations

# Usage
Since there often are muliple variants of the designs the suggested way of 
using the designs is to create a new inkscape drawing and copy the needed
parts there and then put that drawing into your cutting workflow.
